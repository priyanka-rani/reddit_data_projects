funny,nk9ptgq,Shadowkiller00,"I have a sister in law with Tourette's and I did everything I could to make her feel accepted and praise her, but she had to ask me to stop because she was doing everything in her power to mask her disability. Having someone point it out, even in good fun and supportingly, was not fun for her. Then I found out I had stomach cancer. I now no longer have a stomach. Part of my disability is that sometimes I cannot control my burping. Suddenly I was forced to understand what is like to not be able to control yourself and how it feels. My sister in law actually did the same thing back to me that I did to her those years ago and I had to explain to her that it was the same for me as it was with her Tourette's and she apologized profusely because she didn't realize. We now understand each other's disabilities better and we've both grown from it. I'm glad this person's popularity was boosted by this and that people are supporting him, but I would bet 10 1 that he would rather have gotten the same results through any other pathway than this. I've met plenty of people who mask their disabilities and diversities continuously and I've not yet met one who is happy making light of it. That is not to say they don't exist, but i tend to err on the side of assuming it is undesirable. I support this guy as much as anyone, but I do not support him by laughing.
